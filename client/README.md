**Budget Tracker Frontend**

A budget tracker made using React. Shows the budget splits using the 50/30/20 bugeting rule.

This directory contains all the files for the front end of the app. 

Made while watching a tutorial by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyWaXA_NvT0&list=WL&index=18) with some of my own additions. Learned about context and reducer hooks from React as well as GlobalProvider.

To run: $ npm start
